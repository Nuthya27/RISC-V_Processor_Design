# RISC-V Processor Design - (32 -bit, Non Pipelined)

This project aims to design and implement a 32-bit non-pipelined RISC-V processor based on the RV32I architecture using microprogramming and a 3-bus architecture. This processor executes instructions from multiple classes, specifically R and I, Load and Store, and SB. The implementation follows a systematic process, which includes the stages of instruction fetch, decode, and execute.
